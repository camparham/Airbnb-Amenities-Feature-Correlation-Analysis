## Airbnb Amenities & Feature Correlation Analysis

## Goal
Analyze how features like number of beds, bathrooms, and amenities influence each other using correlation heatmaps, and identify insights that could inform property listing strategies.

## 

Conclusatory summary
‚úÖ Learnings

Core features like number of guests, bedrooms, and beds are strongly correlated, indicating that listings scale in tandem across these attributes.

Amenities like Wi-Fi, kitchen, and dedicated workspace show weak or no correlation with layout-based features, suggesting that they are independent choices made by hosts rather than tied to property size.

Notably, 19 of the 28 most frequently booked listings accommodate 4 or more guests, indicating that larger listings may attract higher booking volume, especially for group or family travel.

Weak or zero correlation among amenities (e.g., garden view, on-street parking) implies that location-specific amenities do not scale predictably with property layout.

üîç What Could Be Done Next

Regression analysis: Predict pricing or booking frequency based on feature and amenity combinations.

Clustering: Group listings by feature/amenity profiles to identify market segments (e.g., budget-friendly vs. remote work‚Äìoptimized properties).

Time-series analysis: Track how amenity preferences or price trends evolve over time across regions.

Sentiment or review analysis: Explore if feature-rich listings correlate with higher ratings or review sentiment.

üåç Real-World Implications

Hosts may benefit from adding high-value amenities (like Wi-Fi, workspace) regardless of listing size, since they‚Äôre independent levers that improve appeal.

Listings designed for larger groups could increase booking frequency, making multi-room properties potentially more profitable.

Investors and property managers can use correlation insights to strategically upgrade properties and tailor offerings to match booking patterns and guest expectations.
